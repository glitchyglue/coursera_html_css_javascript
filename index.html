          <h2>delhi</h2>
          <p>New Delhi, the capital of India, is a bustling metropolis that has an amazing mix of modernisation and carefully preserved antiquity. Sprawled over the west bank of the river Yamuna, it is one of the fastest growing cities in India. New Delhi was built by a British architect Edward Lutyens in 1912 as the new capital of the British Raj. The Victorian architecture now intermingles with the city's high rise buildings. Concrete flyovers built to ease the growing traffic are interspersed with well laid gardens, Mughal tombs, forts and monuments.</p>

          <h2>mumbai</h2>
          <p>The city Mumbai, know as Bombay until 1995, is a great port city, situated on the west coast of the Indian peninsula. It is one of India's dominant urban centers and, indeed, is one of the largest and most densely populated cities in the world. Deriving its name from Mumba Devi, a goddess of the local Koli fishing peoples, Mumbai grew up around a fort established by the British in the mid-seventeenth century to protect their trading interests along India's western coast. The city's superb natural harbor provided a focal point for sea routes crossing the Arabian Sea, and Mumbai soon became the main western gateway to Britain's expanding Indian empire.</p>

          <h2>kolkata</h2>
          <p>Kolkata, Bengali Kalikata, formerly Calcutta, city, capital of West Bengal state, and former capital (1772–1911) of British India. It is one of India’s largest cities and one of its major ports. The city is centred on the east bank of the Hugli (Hooghly) River, once the main channel of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 96 miles (154 km) upstream from the head of the Bay of Bengal; there the port city developed as a point of transshipment from water to land and from river to sea. A city of commerce, transport, and manufacture, Kolkata is the dominant urban centre of eastern India.</p>
